Here ordered logistic regression is fitted. The multicollinearity problem disappears only if the top ten Fisher information variables (from the report by Ren&Yang) are used as predictors.
The .R file shows the creation of .csv's. When testing within training data, OLR with the specified variables performs worse than the random forest.
The .csv files represent fitted probabilities for the classes. One way to use this data is to pick the predicted class instead of the whole array of the probabilities.
